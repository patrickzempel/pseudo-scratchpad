# pseudo-scratchpad
A quick and dirty implementation of the i3wm scratchpad in xfce

## But why ? 
I recently switched from [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) to [xfce](https://xfce.org/) and while I really like the more user-friendly environment with less tinkering, I missed one special feature of [i3wm](https://i3wm.org) - [the scratchpad](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_scratchpad).

So I decided to make my own version of it for xfce. The most important part of this solution was taken from this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26840274) by [funivan](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4053996/funivan) from stackoverflow.
